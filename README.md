# iOS MVVM Clean Architecture (SwiftUI + Combine)

## Project Description
This is a sample iOS application built using SwiftUI, Combine, and MVVM with Clean Architecture. The app demonstrates clean separation of concerns, reactive data handling, and scalable architecture.
It uses Core Data for local persistence to manage Income, Expense, and Goal data, and URLSession for network-based API calls. Business logic is handled through Use Cases, with Repository patterns abstracting data sources. The project also includes unit tests for key components.
